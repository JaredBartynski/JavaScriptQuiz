# JavaScriptQuiz

This project was to create a JavaScript quiz.
I had to create an index, style, and script file for this project. I kept the style minimum but could add to it to make the buttons and quiz more appealing.
It was required to put in a timer and to store high scores. I did that all in the javascript using local storage.
